			<h1>Simon Tanner</h1>
			<p>I created this website to apply for the Teacher Ambassador position. I am an experienced elementary
			school and TEFL teacher, have taught using a wide range of new technologies and so understand how helfpul they
		are to engage children in their learning. I am very interested in learning about education technology and recently completed a web development course
	which has given me a good technical understanding. I would enjoy building relationships with schools and teachers to support the modernization
	of their teaching techniques and could effectively communicate the benefits of the product over social media or at events. Please have a look at my experience below.  </p>

				<p class="left">Children took photos of themselves in different gym positions, then using the educreations app annotated the pictures to show the different acute, obtuse and right angles they had formed with
					their bodies.</p>

			<div class="body">
				<p class="left">I kept a class blog which provided the children with an audience for their writing and gave them a real purpose for their posts. They could also leave constructive
					feedback on each otherâ€™s work.</p>
